This thesis required a lot of effort and motivation. Fabian Kleinrad and his excellent work always pushed me to perform harder than I would've ever been able alone. For this I am very thankful. 

I would also like to thank everyone who read this thesis and contributed insight from a non-technical standpoint, improving its overall quality and readability. 

Most notably, I want to thank my family and friends for their support throughout the past 4 years.
