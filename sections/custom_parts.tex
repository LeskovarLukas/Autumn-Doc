\textbf{Author: Fabian Kleinrad} 

This chapter is going to take a look at the practical side of the autumn project. When working with hardware there is the inevitable need for parts fit for the underling application. In case of autumn, with the Matrice 100 being in the center of the project the need arises to design and manufacture parts in order to make the hardware portion in autumn come together without any complication and potential weak points in the final product.

\section{Reasons}

The goal of the autumn project being as innovative and unique in terms of methods used in the realization of the project, parts needed are either not readily available or not compliant with the budget. Another difficulty are parts too specific for there to be any commercially available. Therefor to guaranty the reusability and reliability of the final product, methods to design and produce parts specifically tailored to the needs in the autumn project have to be utilized.
