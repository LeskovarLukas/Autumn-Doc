Our implementation uses a probabilistic roadmap method (PRM) with bidirectional rapidly exploring random trees (BI-RRT) as the local planner. With small modifications to the standard algorithms, we obtain a multiple query planner which is significantly faster and more reliable than its component parts. Our method provides a smooth spectrum between the PRM and BI-RRT techniques and obtains the advantages of both. We observed that the performance differences are most notable in planning instances with several rigid nonconvex robots in a scene with narrow passages. Our work is in the spirit of non-uniform sampling and refinement techniques used in earlier work on PRM.},

@article{Karaman2011,
	abstract = {During the last decade, incremental sampling-based motion planning algorithms, such as the Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs), have been shown to work well in practice and to possess theoretical guarantees such as probabilistic completeness. However, no theoretical bounds on the quality of the solution obtained by these algorithms, e.g., in terms of a given cost function, have been established so far. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap, by designing efficient incremental sampling-based algorithms with provable optimality properties. The first contribution of this paper is a negative result: it is proven that, under mild technical conditions, the cost of the best path returned by RRT converges almost surely to a non-optimal value, as the number of samples increases. Second, a new algorithm is considered, called the Rapidly-exploring Random Graph (RRG), and it is shown that the cost of the best path returned by RRG converges to the optimum almost surely. Third, a tree version of RRG is introduced, called RRT∗, which preserves the asymptotic optimality of RRG while maintaining a tree structure like RRT. The analysis of the new algorithms hinges on novel connections between sampling-based motion planning algorithms and the theory of random geometric graphs. In terms of computational complexity, it is shown that the number of simple operations required by both the RRG and RRT∗ algorithms is asymptotically within a constant factor of that required by RRT.},

An extensive literature review showed that the A* and Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithms and their variants are the most promising path planning algorithms candidates for 3D UAV scenarios. These two algorithms are tested in different complexity 3D scenarios consisting of a box and a combination of vertical and horizontal plane obstacles with apertures. The path length and generation time are considered as the performance measures. The A* with a spectrum of resolutions, the standard RRT with different step size constraints, RRT without step size constraints and the Multiple RRT (MRRT) with various seeds are implemented and their performance measures compared. Results confirm that all algorithms are able to generate a path in all scenarios for all resolutions, step sizes and seeds considered, respectively. Overall A*‘s path length is more optimal and generation time is shorter than RRT projecting A* as a better candidate for online 3D path planning of UAVs.},

Number of Path Finding and Search algorithms was applied to various environments, and their performance compared. The number of searches and also the computation time increases as the number of nodes increases. The various algorithms studied are Dijkstra's algorithm, Bellman Ford's algorithm, Floyd-Warshall's algorithm and the AStar algorithm. These search algorithms were compared. The results show that the AStar algorithm performed better than the other search algorithms.

We utilize a realtime sampling approach based on the Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm that has enjoyed wide success in robotics. More specifically, our algorithm is based on the RRT∗ and informed RRT∗ variants. We contribute by introducing an online tree rewiring strategy that allows the tree root to move with the agent without discarding previously sampled paths. Our method also does not have to wait for the tree to be fully built, as tree expansion and taking actions are interleaved. To our knowledge, this is the first real-time variant of RRT∗. We demonstrate our method, dubbed Real-Time RRT∗ (RT-RRT∗), in navigating a maze with moving enemies that the controlled agent is required to avoid within a predefined radius. Our method finds paths to new targets considerably faster when compared to CL-RRT, a previously proposed real-time RRT variant.},

A recently proposed extension of RRT, known as Rapidly Exploring Random Tree Star (RRT*), claims to achieve convergence towards the optimal solution but has been proven to take an infinite time to do so and with a slow convergence rate. To overcome these limitations, we propose an extension of RRT*, called RRT*-Smart, which aims to accelerate its rate of convergence and to reach an optimum or near optimum solution at a much faster rate and at a reduced execution time. Our novel algorithm inculcates two new techniques in RRT*: these are path optimization and intelligent sampling.

@article{Schmitt2017,
	abstract = {The additive manufacturing processes emerged at the end of the last century and became popular by low-cost 3D printers. The most used printers work on a cartesian configuration, but recently were launched delta machines. These 3D printers use a more complex control system due to their trajectories generation but may present some advantages over the cartesian configuration. To increase the knowledge about additive manufacturing, a comparative study with cartesian and delta printers was performed to evaluate the performance on printing a testing part. Three samples were produced in each printer and compared based on surface quality, manufacturing time, mass and dimensional measurement. The printed objects were 3D scanned for comparing the digitized geometry by aligning the point cloud generated to its virtual 3D model. The parts produced in delta printer obtained better surface quality, while cartesian printer provided better dimensional accuracy. The results also showed that the variation of the mass and time to produce the parts were not significant.},
