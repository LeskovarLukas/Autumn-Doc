@article{Bekris2003,
	abstract = {We propose a combination of techniques that solve multiple queries for motion planning problems with single query planners. Our implementation uses a probabilistic roadmap method (PRM) with bidirectional rapidly exploring random trees (BI-RRT) as the local planner. With small modifications to the standard algorithms, we obtain a multiple query planner which is significantly faster and more reliable than its component parts. Our method provides a smooth spectrum between the PRM and BI-RRT techniques and obtains the advantages of both. We observed that the performance differences are most notable in planning instances with several rigid nonconvex robots in a scene with narrow passages. Our work is in the spirit of non-uniform sampling and refinement techniques used in earlier work on PRM.},

@article{Karaman2011,
	abstract = {During the last decade, incremental sampling-based motion planning algorithms, such as the Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs), have been shown to work well in practice and to possess theoretical guarantees such as probabilistic completeness. However, no theoretical bounds on the quality of the solution obtained by these algorithms, e.g., in terms of a given cost function, have been established so far. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap, by designing efficient incremental sampling-based algorithms with provable optimality properties. The first contribution of this paper is a negative result: it is proven that, under mild technical conditions, the cost of the best path returned by RRT converges almost surely to a non-optimal value, as the number of samples increases. Second, a new algorithm is considered, called the Rapidly-exploring Random Graph (RRG), and it is shown that the cost of the best path returned by RRG converges to the optimum almost surely. Third, a tree version of RRG is introduced, called RRT∗, which preserves the asymptotic optimality of RRG while maintaining a tree structure like RRT. The analysis of the new algorithms hinges on novel connections between sampling-based motion planning algorithms and the theory of random geometric graphs. In terms of computational complexity, it is shown that the number of simple operations required by both the RRG and RRT∗ algorithms is asymptotically within a constant factor of that required by RRT.},
